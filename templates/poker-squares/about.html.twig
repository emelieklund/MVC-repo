<h1>About Poker Squares</h1>

<p>
    Poker Squares is a solitaire game where the player should try and get poker hands in every column and row in a 5x5 grid.
    You can see all different poker hands down below and the points they are providing.
</p>
<p>
    If you create a user, you can make a bet before playing by filling in a form. You guess how many points you think you will receive (at least)
    and how much money you want to bet. Further down on this page, you can see an approximate graph over points guessed and the percentage profit/loss
    it will provide. The higher the points you guess, the higher the profit and the lower the loss.
    After a game, you can save you highscore to a highscore list. If you play as a registered user, your highscore will be saved to your profile
    if it is higher than the highscore already saved. When creating a user you will get a starting sum of 100, and this value will change
    after playing a betting round.
